# Convoluted Proofs

A collection of absurdly sophisticated proofs of simple mathematical facts in Lean 4.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how simple mathematical facts can be proven using unnecessarily complex mathematical machinery. It's inspired by the MathOverflow question ["Awfully sophisticated proof for simple facts"](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/42512/awfully-sophisticated-proof-for-simple-facts) and Asaf Karagila's proof of the irrationality of ‚àö2 using ultrafilters.

## Theorems Proved

### 1. Irrationality of ‚àö2 (`irrational_sqrt_2`)
**Statement**: ‚àö2 is irrational.

**Convoluted approach**: 
- Uses Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions to get infinitely many primes ‚â° 3 (mod 8)
- Constructs a non-principal ultrafilter on this infinite set using the hyperfilter
- Applies quadratic reciprocity to show 2 is not a square mod p for these primes
- Derives a contradiction by showing if ‚àö2 = a/b, then 2 would be a square mod p

**Reference**: Based on [Asaf Karagila's proof](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1311228/what-is-the-most-unusual-proof-you-know-that-sqrt2-is-irrational) (see comments)

### 2. Bounded Periodic Functions are A.E. Continuous (`bounded_periodic_ae_eq_continuous`)
**Statement**: Every bounded 2œÄ-periodic function ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ equals a continuous function almost everywhere.

**Convoluted approach**:
- Works on the circle T = ‚Ñù/(2œÄ‚Ñ§) with Haar measure
- Invokes Carleson's theorem (1966) on pointwise convergence of Fourier series
- Uses Fej√©r sums (Ces√†ro means) and their uniform convergence
- References Calder√≥n-Zygmund theory, singular integrals, and the Hilbert transform
- Mentions Hardy-Littlewood maximal theorem

**Note**: Proof left incomplete with `sorry`

### 3. Indicator Function is A.E. Continuous (`indicator_ae_continuous`)
**Statement**: The indicator function of [0,1] equals a continuous function almost everywhere.

**Convoluted approach**:
- Extends indicator to a 2-periodic function and computes Fourier coefficients
- Applies Carleson's theorem for pointwise convergence
- Uses Fej√©r sums (continuous trigonometric polynomials)
- Invokes Egorov's theorem to upgrade a.e. convergence
- References distribution theory, Sobolev embeddings, and BV functions

**Note**: This is a false statement - the "proof" is intentionally flawed! Indicator functions are not a.e. equal to continuous functions.

### 4. Bounded Functions Have Antiderivatives (`bounded_has_antiderivative`)
**Statement**: Every bounded function on [0,1] has an antiderivative.

**Convoluted approach**:
- Extends function periodically and considers its Fourier series
- Uses Carleson's theorem for pointwise convergence a.e.
- Constructs antiderivative by formally integrating Fourier series term by term
- Applies uniform convergence to show differentiability
- References Paley-Wiener theorems, Littlewood-Paley theory, and Calder√≥n-Zygmund decomposition

**Reference**: Direct example from the MathOverflow thread - using Carleson's theorem to prove Riemann integrability

**Note**: Proof incomplete with `sorry`

### 5. Existence of Discontinuous Functions (`discontinuous_function_exists`)
**Statement**: There exists a function from ‚Ñù to ‚Ñù that is not continuous.

**Convoluted approach**:
- Proof by contradiction assuming all functions are continuous
- Uses cardinal arithmetic: if all functions were continuous, then #(‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù) ‚â§ #(‚Ñö ‚Üí ‚Ñù)
- Applies density of ‚Ñö in ‚Ñù and that continuous functions are determined by values on dense subsets
- Shows this implies ùî†^ùî† ‚â§ ùî†^‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ = ùî†
- Derives contradiction using Cantor's theorem: ùî† < ùî†^ùî†
